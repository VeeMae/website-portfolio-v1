# website-portfolio-v1

This is the first version of my portfolio. With the progression of this project, I slowly experimented with darker colors and emoji characters to show my personality some more.

The website started out without any bootstrap, but once I finished the tasks for the CareerFoundry exercise that this specific project is tied to, I decided to add bootstrap in order to make major updates to highlight my personal style and design preferences.
