# Portfolio

This is the first version of my portfolio. It started it with light colors to put the focus on the content. But I soon began to experiment with darker colors and mixing dark purple with light coral tones, light purples, and variations of dark green. What you'll see is the result of that, and a lot more of my personality coming through.

I started out using only HTML and CSS, but with the addition of new colors, I implemented Bootstrap to help with different parts of my UI.

My contact form is fully functional with the help of Typeform. All responses go straight to my email: hello@venusmae.dev. So, rest assured that I'll respond to each one within 24 hours or less.
