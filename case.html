          Project: myFlix Application (Angular Version)
          <br />
          <br />
          The myFlix app allows users to register an account in order to view a list of movies,
          details about a selected movie, add or delete movies to/from user's list of favorites, and
          update or delete user's profile account.
        </p>

        />

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Purpose and Context</h1>
        <p>
          This project was one of six applications that I built as part of CareerFoundry's Web
          Development program. In an earlier project, I had already created the myFlix appliction
          using the MERN stack. In this particular project however, I'll be showcasing the myFlix
          application using the MEAN stack. Instead of using React for the client-side, this version
          uses Angular. Apart from the change in client-side development, the rest of the
          application uses the same server-side (REST API and database) development that the React
          version uses.
        </p>

        <h1 id="case-header">Objective</h1>
        <p>
          The goal in creating this application is to add another well-known framework to my full
          stack web development skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          The problem I was trying to solve is how to expand my limited client-side development
          knowledge in order to be more marketable as a web developer.
        </p>

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Duration</h1>
        <p>
          Overall, the project took one week to complete (mostly because I only needed to change the
          client-side build, while keeping the server-side API and database the same). Majority of
          the time was spent learning a new language that was commonly used with Angular -
          TypeScript. But once I got my footing, I actually enjoyed the process and was able to
          finish in a short amount of time.

            - As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres
            so that I can learn more about movies I've watched or am interested in.
          </li>
          <li>
            - As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite
            movies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With these user stories, I was able to implement the proper API endpoints required to
          fetch or request data from the database. For a full documentation of the endpoints, please

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Server-side Development</h1>
        <p>
          I built a REST API that interacts with a NoSQL, document-based database, called MongoDB.
          The API also uses Node, Express, Mongoose for the business logic, and authentication and
          authorization logic that allows users to safely log in after registering an account.

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <p>
          To make sure all HTTP requests were processed accordingly, the API was tested using
          Postman.
        </p>

        <h1 id="case-header">Client-side Development</h1>
        <p>
          Using Angular, I built the interfaces that users would be interacting with, which include
          the welcome, registration, login, movies, and profile pages. The rest of the UI components
          were designed using Angular Material. Overall, the separation of components and templates
          made it convenient to fetch/request the necessary data, while also keeping the UI simple
          and clean.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users begin their journey through the app by registering an account via the 'Sign Up'
          button, and then logging their credentials via the 'Login' button. The welcome page
          displays two buttons that both render an interactive modal.
        </p>

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <p>
          Once the users have logged in, they are presented with the movies homepage. It displays
          all the movies from the database in the form of individual cards. Each card shows the
          title, director, and several buttons to allow the user to check more information on the
          genre, the director, the synopsis, or to add the selected movie to their list of
          favorites.

          The user can then go to their profile page by clicking on the 'Profile' button, located at
          the top right corner. They can change their user information or delete a movie that is
          listed under 'Favorite Movies'.

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <p>
          Users also have the option of deleting their profile from the database entirely by
          clicking on the 'Delete Profile' button at the top right corner, right after the 'Logout'
          button. (No worries with accidentally clicking it - there is a confirmation modal asking
          if the user wants to proceed. Users can just press the 'escape' key, click the 'cancel'
          option, or click anywhere outside the modal to exit.)

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Challenges</h1>
        <p>
          The main challenge I overcame throughout this whole project was the learning curve for the
          Angular framework and its commonly used programming language - TypeScript. Since
          TypeScript is a new language for me, I had to familiarize myself with the syntax and its
          use of generics. I read articles on Angular and TypeScript to better understand how more
          experienced developers approach these concepts, as well as watching YouTube videos to see
          how functions and components were being implemented. Once I had a pretty decent
          understanding, I really enjoyed developing this project.
          <br />
          <br />
          In fact, it's a favorite project of mine and here's why. There was a situation where I was
          struggling to fetch the movies for the updated username, and the process of debugging and
          console logging the responses were very memorable to me - not because of the all-nighters
          I pulled to solve the issue, but because that situation was when I realized the power of
          console logging and it has changed my perspective since. It sounds a bit weird, but let me
          articulate.
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout my whole CareerFoundry journey of developing projects, I never really used
          console logs, simply because I would just try and figure out the solution through trial
          and error (which worked for me most of the time). But with this project, I decided to
          console log a whole lot of results and responses to see what data I was actually
          receiving/requesting. These logs helped with identifying what type of errors I was getting
          and where it was occurring. Because of this experience, I felt like I've grown immensely
          in regard to my debugging process. Although I've learned other testing methods such as the
          test-driven development technique, I feel a lot more comfortable using the simplicity and
          power of console logging.
        </p>

        <h1 id="case-header">Reflections</h1>
        <p>
          Looking back at all the work I've done for this project, I feel genuinely proud of myself
          for several reasons. One, I learned to program in a new language, which I can now continue
          to hone. Two, I realized the best debugging method for me and will happily use in my
          future projects. Lastly, it was the final project of the CareerFoundry program, and a
          milestone reminding me of how far I've come. Not to mention, it was such an enjoyable
          project to do; I thoroughly enjoyed testing out Angular Material's various UI components.
          <br />
          <br />
          My original objective was to learn a popular client-side framework to add to my skillset.
          Despite some challenges along the way, I have successfully completed the objective and
          more. Moving forward, I now know how to approach the development process in a way that
          allows me to catch errors quickly and more effectively, make decisions on what library or
          framework to use for future projects (since I can now develop with two major ones), and
          learn new languages/frameworks/libraries through dedicated reading and research.
