          Project: myFlix Application (Angular Version)
          <br />
          <br />
          The myFlix app allows users to register an account in order to view a list of movies,
          details about a selected movie, add or delete movies to/from user's list of favorites, and
          update or delete user's profile account.
        </p>

        />

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Purpose and Context</h1>
        <p>
          This project was one of six applications that I built as part of CareerFoundry's Web
          Development program. In an earlier project, I had already created the myFlix appliction
          using the MERN stack. In this particular project however, I'll be showcasing the myFlix
          application using the MEAN stack. Instead of using React for the client-side, this version
          uses Angular. Apart from the change in client-side development, the rest of the
          application uses the same server-side (REST API and database) development that the React
          version uses.
        </p>

        <h1 id="case-header">Objective</h1>
        <p>
          The goal in creating this application is to add another well-known framework to my full
          stack web development skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          The problem I was trying to solve is how to expand my limited client-side development
          knowledge in order to be more marketable as a web developer.

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Duration</h1>
        <p>
          Overall, the project took one week to complete (mostly because I only needed to change the
          client-side build, while keeping the server-side API and database the same). Majority of
          the time was spent learning a new language that was commonly used with Angular -
          TypeScript. But once I got my footing, I actually enjoyed the process and was able to
          finish in a short amount of time.

        <p>
          With these user stories, I was able to implement the proper API endpoints required to
          fetch or request data from the database. For a full documentation of the endpoints, please

        />

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Server-side Development</h1>
        <p>
          I built a REST API that interacts with a NoSQL, document-based database, called MongoDB.
          The API also uses Node.js which allows me to use modules for added functionality and
          JavaScript on the server-side, Express.js which handles all HTTP requests to the API,
          Mongoose for the business logic, and authentication and authorization logic that allows
          users to safely log in after registering an account.
        </p>

        <p>
          With Express, I was able to create requests to the different API endpoints and the
          responses that should be returned for each route. I created an instance of express() with
          these lines of code:
          <br />- const express = require('express');
          <br />
          - const app = express();
          <br />
          <br />
          I then included the HTTP request method for each endpoint. The following image displays
          some of the endpoints I've defined for when a user first enters the app, searches for a
          movie by name or genre, etc.
        </p>
        <img
          class="responsive"
          src="./img/express.png"
          alt="Image of the index.js file which contains the instance of express()"
        />

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <p>
          Since I used MongoDB for the database, I needed a mapper that could work with documents,
          and that's where Mongoose came in (it's an Object Document Mapper, which works with
          MongoDB's document architecture). In addition, I was able to define the schema for the
          data returned from the API using models in Mongoose. This ensured that all data followed a
          specified format and were consistent for user viewing. The following image shows the
          schema I've defined for how the data would look like.
        </p>
        <img
          class="responsive"
          src="./img/mongoose.png"
          alt="Image of the models.js file which contains the schema for the data returned from the API"
        />

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <p>
          As for authentication and authorization, I used both HTTP and JWT-based authentication.
          What this means is that for users who are logging in, they will have to provide both their
          username and password, which will be checked with HTTP authentication. If the app finds
          the user's credentials in the database, then the user gets authenticated and a JWT will be
          generated for the user. Whenever the user makes more requests to the API, the JWT-based
          authentication comes in to authorize those requests (it authenticates the user's JWT). In
          short, in order to use the application, users need to register, log in and get
          authenticated, which gives the user a JWT that then authorizes any other requests. Each
          JWT is good for a day, so users will need to log in again after 24 hours of session.
          <br />
          <br />
          I used Passport, which is an authentication middleware for Express and Node. This
          middleware is what implements the HTTP authentication when users log in, and JWT
          authentication for all other requests thereafter. Passport uses strategies, which permits
          authentication and authorization means (they're just chunks of code). The following image
          shows the HTTP and JWT-based strategies for the security measures previously mentioned.
          The image after that shows the logic behind actually authenticating the user once they log
          in.

          To make sure all HTTP requests were processed accordingly, the API was tested using

        <h1 id="case-header">Challenges During the Server-side Development</h1>
        <p>
          There were a couple challenges I came across while developing the back end. First, it was
          somewhat confusing trying to wrap my head around the concept of Node. I knew it was a
          runtime environment for running JavaScript without a browser, but I wasn't understanding
          what that really meant at the time. I was so used to writing JavaScript for the browser or
          using the browser's console to execute simple commands, so I was confused as to how
          exactly I would write it for the server-side. When I actually began to write JS code
          within the index.js file (which is the default entry point into a Node.js app) to
          implement certain components, it started to make sense. I realized that Node was parsing
          the JavaScript code so that it could be understood by the server. Node also made it
          possible to install modules and packages into my application which further helped in
          creating the back end logic (Express, Passport, and Morgan were some packages/modules I
          used, to name a few). Eventually, it became apparent to me how great Node really was - it
          allowed me to use JavaScript on the server-side, which made the transition from
          client-side programming easier.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another challenge was understanding how to implement the security measures explained
          above. There were quite a few things required to fully authenticate users, and I had to
          familiarize myself with Passport's use of strategies, which were chunks of code that
          defined what the HTTP and JWT authentications did. I then needed to create the actual
          logic that would use those strategies so that clicking the login button and going through
          the authentication phase was executed properly. I've never written code to authenticate
          and authorize users before, so I had to read about them and then explore Passport's use
          cases to make sure I really understood how to implement it.
          <br />
          <br />
          With that said, learning how to code the server-side, as a whole, was a challenge in
          itself. The myFlix application was the first time I ever set foot into server-side
          programming, so the whole experience was a little bit daunting to begin with. But with
          practice, continuous research, and learning from my mistakes, I began to really enjoy it.
          I'm really interested in the concepts of implementing security, choosing the right
          database, the right mapper for the business logic, and creating the API endpoints. They
          feel like a whole new world compared to the client-side, which makes me even more curious
          to explore it further. It's definitely enjoyable as well, so that reinforces my goal in
          becoming a full stack developer!
        </p>

        <div class="case-break"></div>
        <h1 id="case-header">Client-side Development</h1>
        <p>
          Using Angular, I built the interfaces that users would be interacting with, which include
          the welcome, registration, login, movies, and profile pages. The rest of the UI components
          were designed using Angular Material. Overall, the separation of components and templates
          made it convenient to fetch/request the necessary data, while also keeping the UI simple
          and clean.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users begin their journey through the app by registering an account via the 'Sign Up'
          button, and then logging their credentials via the 'Login' button. The welcome page
          displays two buttons that both render an interactive modal.
        </p>

          Once the users have logged in, they are presented with the movies homepage. It displays
          all the movies from the database in the form of individual cards. Each card shows the
          title, director, and several buttons to allow the user to check more information on the
          genre, the director, the synopsis, or to add the selected movie to their list of
          favorites.

        <h1 id="case-header">Challenges</h1>
        <p>
          The main challenge I overcame throughout this whole project was the learning curve for the
          Angular framework and its commonly used programming language - TypeScript. Since
          TypeScript is a new language for me, I had to familiarize myself with the syntax and its
          use of generics. I read articles on Angular and TypeScript to better understand how more
          experienced developers approach these concepts, as well as watching YouTube videos to see
          how functions and components were being implemented. Once I had a pretty decent
          understanding, I really enjoyed developing this project.
          <br />
          <br />
          In fact, it's a favorite project of mine and here's why. There was a situation where I was
          struggling to fetch the movies for the updated username, and the process of debugging and
          console logging the responses were very memorable to me - not because of the all-nighters
          I pulled to solve the issue, but because that situation was when I realized the power of
          console logging and it has changed my perspective since. It sounds a bit weird, but let me
          articulate.
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout my whole CareerFoundry journey of developing projects, I never really used
          console logs, simply because I would just try and figure out the solution through trial
          and error (which worked for me most of the time). But with this project, I decided to
          console log a whole lot of results and responses to see what data I was actually
          receiving/requesting. These logs helped with identifying what type of errors I was getting
          and where it was occurring. Because of this experience, I felt like I've grown immensely
          in regard to my debugging process. Although I've learned other testing methods such as the
          test-driven development technique, I feel a lot more comfortable using the simplicity and
          power of console logging.

          Looking back at all the work I've done for this project, I feel genuinely proud of myself
          for several reasons. One, I learned to program in a new language, which I can now continue
          to hone. Two, I realized the best debugging method for me and will happily use in my
          future projects. Lastly, it was the final project of the CareerFoundry program, and a
          milestone reminding me of how far I've come. Not to mention, it was such an enjoyable
          project to do; I thoroughly enjoyed testing out Angular Material's various UI components.
          <br />
          <br />
          My original objective was to learn a popular client-side framework to add to my skillset.
          Despite some challenges along the way, I have successfully completed the objective and
          more. Moving forward, I now know how to approach the development process in a way that
          allows me to catch errors quickly and more effectively, make decisions on what library or
          framework to use for future projects (since I can now develop with two major ones), and
          learn new languages/frameworks/libraries through dedicated reading and research.
